        <h1 class="Content">ULTRAKILL</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ULTRAKILL is a fast-paced ultraviolent old school first-person shooter developed by Arsi "Hakita" Patala and published by New Blood Interactive. You play as V1, a combat machine fueled by blood who has ventured into the depths of Hell after the extinction of humanity. Hell abounds with demons and tormented souls, sources of blood that you must rend apart in order to refuel yourself and survive.

            ULTRAKILL's gameplay combines features from classic shooters like Quake, modern shooters like Doom (2016) and character action games like Devil May Cry. The game places emphasis on movement, dodging attacks, and efficient gunplay in its arena-style levels. In addition, the player's health can only be restored by showering in the blood of enemies, requiring the player to adopt an aggressive playstyle that regularly places them in close combat with their opponents.
            
            The game's prologue and first act were released in early access on September 3, 2020, and a free demo is available on Steam. You can find ways to help the wiki out here. Please remember that this wiki is unofficial, and we are a small community.

                    <p>Currently, there are 5 base guns with 12 different variations including 2 alternate variants and 3 arms and a WIP variation for you to rend demons apart with. As the game gets closer to completion and the other alternatives to every weapon are added, all of them will be covered here on the index.

                <p>ULTRAKILL offers a variety of enemies that differ vastly in appearance and behavior. They can be categorized into different types: Husks. Demons. Machines and Angels. Enemies are able to damage each other (as well as themselves) during combat, and will actively target each other in some select cases, such as a few scripted events involving Swordsmachine in [ 0-2: THE MEATGRINDER ] or in the multiple rooms of [7-3: NO SOUND, NO MEMORY].

                    Enemies with an asterisk (*) next to their name indicate that they are introduced as a boss early on but appear as normal enemies later in the main story or in the Cyber Grind. Enemies exclusive as bosses are listed differently from standard enemies. Lastly, enemies that don't fall under any of the previously given categories will be given their own unique category.
                    
                    See this Google Doc for data on enemy health, damage, and other miscellaneous statistics.</p>

                <p>The Terminal is a yellow touchscreen terminal found in every level's starting room and before the bossfights (except [ 0-1: INTO THE FIRE ]). The screen lights up when V1 approaches it. It can be interacted with using primary fire key.

                    The Terminal's main menu has four buttons to the left, used to access its main functions: WEAPONS, ENEMIES, THE CYBER GRIND, and SANDBOX. It also has a TIP OF THE DAY, which is different for every level.
